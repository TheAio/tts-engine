tts-engine, say words in computer craft!

Today i would like to introduce my brand new text to speach engine!
It does not always have perfect pronunciation but should be good enough for basic sentances,
you can customize it a little bit in the code.
Anyways what are you waiting for?
run the install script to automatically download it
wget run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheAio/tts-engine/main/install.lua

Note: there are no grantees that the code will work at all, i was sick when programming and therefor did limited testing.
